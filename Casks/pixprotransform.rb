  caveats <<~EOS
    PixProTransform drives Pixelmator Pro, which must be installed, and it works by
    driving Pixelmator's own interface — so it needs Accessibility access
    under System Settings, Privacy & Security, Accessibility. It also asks
    for permission to control Pixelmator Pro the first time it runs. Without
    both it can do nothing at all.
